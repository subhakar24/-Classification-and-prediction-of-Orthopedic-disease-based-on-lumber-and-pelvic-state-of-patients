# -Classification-and-prediction-of-Orthopedic-disease-based-on-lumber-and-pelvic-state-of-patients
Although studies have been done in the medical field with advanced data exploration using machine learning algorithms, orthopaedic disease prediction is still a relatively new area and must be explored further for accurate prevention and cure. We use Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN and Boosting algorithms in our research, which gives us a unique insight into the aforementioned case and provides a comparison for the best-fitted model in the case of predicting orthopaedic diseases.
